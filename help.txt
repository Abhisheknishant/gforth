The Gforth manual is available on
https://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/gforth/Docs-html/
or through your favourite info reader (e.g., "info gforth" from the shell).
To leave Gforth, type "bye", or use Ctrl-D at the start of a line.
To input floating-point numbers, use an exponent, e.g. "1e".
To input double-cell integers without warning, use a base-prefix, e.g. "#1.".
Disable warnings with WARNINGS OFF and reduce warnings with -1 WARNINGS !
Config in ~/.gforthrc0 before loading anything, ~/.gforthrc for interactive mode
